# Topic-modeling-LDA


Topic Modeling - 
It is unsupervised natural language processing which is used to represent a text document with the help of several topics, that can best explain the underlying information in a particular document.We have a collection of words that we want to group together in such a way that each group represents a topic in a document.

Latent: Hidden in the data. Topics that document consists of are unknown, but they are believed to be present as the text is generated based on those topics.

Dirichlet: It is 'distribution of distributions'.Dirichlet is the distribution of topics in documents and distribution of words in the topic. 

Allocation: Allocate topics to the documents and words of the document to topics.

LDA -
The LDA makes two key assumptions:

1.Documents are a mixture of topics, and
2.Topics are a mixture of tokens (or words)
And, these topics using the probability distribution generate the words. In statistical language, the documents are known as the probability density (or distribution) of topics and the topics are the probability density (or distribution) of words.
